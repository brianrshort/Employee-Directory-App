# Employee Directory React App

This project uses react and the Random User API to create a 20-person set of employees with basic employees that can be searched for by name, sorted alphabetically or reversed alphabetically, and filtered based on whether you're looking for employees east of Greenwich Mean Time or west of Greenwich Mean Time. 

# Motivation

The goal of this project was to practice buidling a React app, separating components and concerns, and using useState and useEffect hooks.

# Technologies Use

JavaScript, JSX, React, useState, useEffect. 

# Features

The app allows users to view sets of employees, search by name, organize them by name (alphabetically or reverse alphabetically), and filter users who are either east or west of GMT.
